# Node.js Server Unresponsive to Requests

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js where a server starts but fails to respond to incoming HTTP requests.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem

The provided server successfully starts, listening on port 8080. However, when you try to access it using a web browser or `curl`, you will likely encounter connection errors or timeouts.  The server does not handle or respond to the requests.

## Solution

The issue is typically caused by asynchronous operations within the request handler not being properly handled.  The solution emphasizes this aspect and includes error handling for robustness.
